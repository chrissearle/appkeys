# AppKeys

This is just a simple utility rails app for managing environmental variables and foreman config variables for various rails apps.

It is not intended to be run on a public server, has no authentication and no real styling. No unit tests either :P

I use it mainly for key/secret pairs for apps that use omniauth as well as setting the foreman port - but it's pretty generic - name/value pairs for both environment (.env) and config (.foreman)
